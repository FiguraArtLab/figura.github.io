title: FIGURA
description: > 
  Welcome to my audio-visual creative lab - Figura! My background is in computer science with focus on computer graphics. 
  During my PhD I have specialized in procedural modeling and rendering. 
  Now, I am working in industry as Procedural Technical Artist.
  Here, you can find more (art)work from me which is available for purchase.
  My goal is to create work of asethetic value using advanced procedural modeling techniques.
  NO AI/ML is used in any of my work - I am creating stuff that can't be explained to AI.
